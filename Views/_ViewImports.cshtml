@* This file contains directives that are imported into every view in the same directory and its subdirectories.
   It's used to reduce redundancy by adding common namespaces and tag helpers across multiple views. *@

@* The 'using' directive makes the 'MyCalendar' namespace available to all views.
   This allows the use of types defined in 'MyCalendar' without having to specify the full namespace each time. *@
@using MyCalendar

@* The 'using' directive for 'MyCalendar.Models'.
   It makes all the types within 'MyCalendar.Models' namespace available to the views,
   typically used for accessing model types that are passed to the views. *@
@using MyCalendar.Models

@* Adds the tag helpers from the 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers' assembly.
   This enables the use of ASP.NET Core's built-in Tag Helpers in views,
   which are used to enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.
   The '*' character means it imports all tag helpers from the specified assembly. *@
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
